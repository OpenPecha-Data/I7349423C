O Venerable Ones, the many śaikṣa dharmas have been recited by me. Therefore, I ask the Venerable Ones-Are you completely

the Venerable Ones are completely pure in this matter. Thus do I understand.

Adhikaraṇa-Śamatha Dharmas

Now, O Venerable Ones, the seven adhikaraṇa-śamatha dharmas come up in the half-monthly Prātimokṣa Sūtra recitation.
