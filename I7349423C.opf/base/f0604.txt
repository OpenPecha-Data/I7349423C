O Venerable Ones, the four pārājika dharmas have been recited by me. Whatever monk, having committed one or another fault
, is not to obtain dwelling or eating together with the monks. As before (he became a monk, he was a layman), so after (
that he committed the pārājika he becomes a layman again),1 he is (thus) pārājika and the monks cannot liv with him. The
refore, I ask the Venerable Ones-Are you completely pure in this matter?A second and also a third time I ask the Venerab
le Ones-Are you completely pure in this matter?Since there is silence, the Venerable Ones are completely pure in this ma
tter. Thus do I understand.

The Thirteen Saṃghāvaśeṣa Dharmas

Now, O Venerable Ones, the thirteen saṃghāvaśeṣa dharmas come up in the half-monthly Prātimokṣa Sutra recitation.
