10. Whatever monk should proceed toward a division of a saṃgha which is harmonious, or having taken up a legal question c
onducive to causing a schism, should persist in taking it up, that monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: “The Vene
rable One should not proceed toward a division of the saṃgha which is harmonious, or having taken up a legal question co
nducive to causing a schism, persist in taking it up. Let the Venerable One come together with the saṃgha, for the saṃgh
a is harmonious, united, on friendly terms, without dispute, and dwells in a happy condition under a one-pointed Dharma 
exposition, being like milk and water, demonstrating the Teaching”?” of the Teacher. Abandon, O Venerable One, such a co
urse which causes a schism in the saṃgha.” If that monk, being spoken to by the monks, should abandon that course,". thi
s is good. If he should not abandon it, he should be examined and instructed a second and a third time for the abandonme
nt of that course. Should he, being examined and instructed a second and a third time, abandon that course, this is good
. If he should not abandon it, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.
