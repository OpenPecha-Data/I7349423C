6. When a monk, by begging himself, is having a hut built, having no donor and intended for himself, the hut should be bu
ilt according to measure. This is the measure for the hut: in length, twelve spans of the Sugata-span in width, seven sp
ans inside. Monks should be brought by that monk for viewing the site. The site should be viewed by those monks who are 
brought to not involve slaughter and be good for roaming about. If the monk should have the hut built, for which he begg
ed himself, having no donor and intended for himself, on a site which involves destruction and is not good for roaming a
bout, or should he not bring monks to view the site, or should he exceed the measure on a site which has not been viewed
by the, monks who were not brought, that is a saṃghāvaśeṣa.
