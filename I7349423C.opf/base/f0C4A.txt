ordance with the Vinaya, concerning the moral precepts included in the exposition and included in the Sūtras of the Suga
ta, makes himself one who is not to be spoken to, saying, “Do not, O Venerable Ones, say anything to me, either good or 
bad, and also I will not say anything good or bad to the Venerable Ones. Let the Venerable Ones abstain from speaking to
me, and also I will abstain from speaking to you”; that monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: “You, o Venerable O
ne, being spoken to by the monks in accordance with the Dharma and in accordance with the Vinaya, concerning the moral p
recepts included in the exposition and included in the Sūtras of the Sugata, make yourself one who is not to be spoken t
o. Let the Venerable One make himself one who is to be spoken to. Let the monks speak to the Venerable One in accordance
with the Dharma and in accordance with the Vinaya, and also let the Venerable One speak to the monks in accordance with
the Dharma and in accordance with the Vinaya, for thus, through mutual speech and through mutual helping to eliminate f
aults, will the community of the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the Arhant, the Fully Enlightened One, be bound together. D
o not let the Venerable One make himself one who is not to be spoken to.” That monk should be spoken to thus by the monk
