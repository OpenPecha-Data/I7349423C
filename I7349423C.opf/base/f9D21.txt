O Venerable Ones, the thirteen saṃghāvaśeṣa dharmashave been recited by me: nine which become faults at once and four whi
ch do not become faults up to the third admonition. If a monk has fallen into one or another of these [faults], so much 
time [parivāsa] should be spent by that [monk], even unwillingly, as he knowingly conceals it. When that monk, even unwi
llingly, has completed the parivāsa, six more nights should be spent [undergoing] mānatva in the saṃgha. When the mānatv
a has been completed, the monk, with satisfied mind, should be pardoned by the avarhana ceremony” by the Bhikṣu-saṃgha, 
done according to Dharma. If the; Bhikṣu-saṃgha is a group of twenty, that monk should be reinstated. If a Bhikṣu-saṃgha
should reinstate that monk while being a group of twenty lacking by even one [monk], that monk is not reinstated and th
e monks are blameworthy. This is the proper conduct. Therefore, I ask the Venerable Ones-Are you completely pure in this
matter?A second and also a third time I ask the Venerable Ones-Are you completely pure in this matter?Since there is si
lence, the Venerable Ones are completely pure in this matter. Thus do I understand.

The Two Aniyata Dharmas

Now, O Venerable Ones, the two aniyata dharmas come up in the halfmonthly Prātimokṣa Sūtra recitation.
